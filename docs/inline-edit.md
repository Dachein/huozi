# Inline Edit — Spec

The "select text → edit" affordance on the workspace view page. Powers the
read-only-by-default Web UI's only write surface, going through the same
`huozi_edit` MCP tool an Agent would call.

This spec covers the framework: object model, selection→object resolution,
per-type strategies, and the display-overlay layer. Per-type details
(which mdast / DOM nodes count as objects, byte-encoding rules) live in
each strategy file's docblock.

Read alongside `four-types.md` (data-type framing) and
`packages/huozi-cloud/SPEC.md` (huozi_edit semantics on the server side).

---

## 1. Goals & non-goals

**Goals.**

- A user selects text in the rendered view, clicks "Edit", types new text,
  saves. The save lands as a normal `huozi_edit` commit, audited as the
  user.
- The flow works on all four data types — md, html, csv, jsonl — with
  one shared resolution rule and one shared modal.
- Each type's "what is the smallest editable unit" is a per-type concern,
  not a framework concern.
- Bytes-in equals bytes-out: anything the user didn't change comes back
  byte-identical, so `huozi_edit`'s exact-string semantics holds.

**Non-goals.**

- Rich-text editing (bold via toolbar, drag-drop images, etc.). The user
  edits source bytes; the rendered view is read-only-with-an-edit-loop,
  not a WYSIWYG editor.
- Multi-object batch edits. One save = one object.
- Conflict resolution beyond `parent_blob_sha` staleness checks.
  Concurrent writes to the same object surface as a `MODIFIED_SINCE_READ`
  error and the user retries.

---

## 2. The Object Model

The framework's atom is **EditObject** — the smallest editable unit at
the file's natural granularity. Each of the four types defines its own:

| Type    | Default object              | DOM marker                             |
|---------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **md**  | inline node (`strong`, `em`, `a`, `code`, `td`, `li`, heading) or `p` if no inline ancestor | `data-obj-src="<startByte>,<endByte>"` injected by `lib/markdown/source-pos.ts` |
| **html**| any paired/void element     | `data-obj-src` injected by `lib/html/source-pos.ts` (every open tag) |
| **csv** | one cell                    | none (canvas grid — click-driven only)  |
| **jsonl**| one (line, fieldKey) pair  | `data-obj-src="jsonl:line:<n>:field:<k>"` on the rendered field span |

Every object carries:

```ts
interface EditObject {
  kind: 'md-inline' | 'html-element' | 'csv-cell' | 'jsonl-field'
  locator: ObjectLocator              // type-discriminated, see types.ts
  initialText: string                 // what lands in the modal textarea
  anchorRect?: DOMRect                // for popover positioning
}
```

The locator is what `edit-modal.tsx` hands to the strategy at save time
to compute `(old_string, new_string)`.

---

## 3. Selection → Object resolution

Two entry paths, one resolution rule.

### 3.1 Selection-driven (md / html / jsonl)

The user's text selection inside the rendered DOM. Run **least common
data-obj ancestor**:

```
A = startContainer's nearest [data-obj-src] ancestor (walking up)
B = endContainer's nearest [data-obj-src] ancestor

if A === B:                  return A
if A is ancestor of B:       return A   ← selection straddles a smaller
                                          object inside A; widen to A
if B is ancestor of A:       return B   ← mirror case
else (disjoint subtrees):    return whichever appears first
                                          in document order
```

This rule covers the three intent cases in one function:

| Selection vs. default object | Resolution                             |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Subset (within one object)   | `A === B` → that object                |
| Exactly equals one object    | `A === B` → that object                |
| Spans into a nested object   | LCA → the parent object                |
| Spans across siblings        | First in document order                |

Concrete worked example —
`<p>讲完观察, ...是<strong>不要再...&ldquo;Agent 文档 API&rdquo;</strong>。</p>`:

| User selects                            | A         | B         | Result          |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| "Agent 文档 API" (inside strong)        | `strong`  | `strong`  | `strong` inner  |
| "讲完观察" (only paragraph text)        | `p`       | `p`       | `p` inner       |
| "讲完..." through "API\u201d" (crosses) | `p`       | `strong`  | `p` inner (LCA) |

**Block widening.** After LCA resolves to `R`, if `R` doesn't fully
contain BOTH selection endpoints (the user's drag escaped `R`), walk
up to the nearest BLOCK-tagged ancestor with `data-obj-src` (`li`, `p`,
`h1`–`h6`, `td`, `th`, `blockquote`, `pre`). That block is the smallest
"complete unit" the user can edit. This handles two real cases:

1. Selection inside one `<strong>` extends into the surrounding text →
   LCA = `strong`, widen → containing `<p>` or `<li>`.
2. Selection spans two list items via their `<strong>` text →
   LCA = first `<strong>` (disjoint), widen → first `<li>`. The user
   gets that whole list item; the cross-item content of the selection
   is dropped (one save = one block). Matches the SPEC's "snap to
   first" rule, just elevated to a complete unit instead of a partial
   inline.

**Markdown block-marker stripping.** `<li>`'s `data-obj-src` covers the
list marker (`- `, `* `, `+ `, `1. `, …) which is renderer markup, not
content. Same for `<h1>`–`<h6>` (`#`–`######` plus space). The surface
strips these prefixes before opening the modal — mirrors what
`findHtmlInnerRange` does for HTML tags. Other blocks (`<p>`, `<td>`,
`<blockquote>`, `<pre>`) either have no inline-level prefix or need
line-by-line treatment; not handled in v1.

**Sub-object narrowing.** When the user's selection is a strict subset
of the resolved object — and it lives in a single text node, and its
plain text appears exactly once in the editable scope — the modal opens
with just those bytes instead of the whole object. The substring search
naturally screens out unsafe selections: any selection that crossed an
inline tag, an entity widget, or a `<br>` will fail the search (the
rendered text doesn't include the markup bytes) and we degrade back to
object granularity.

When narrowing isn't safe (selection spans element boundaries, text
isn't unique, or it's a triple-click whole-object selection), the modal
keeps object granularity. The anchor-expansion math at save time is the
same in both cases.

### 3.2 Click-driven (csv / jsonl)

Renderers without selectable source-mapped DOM dispatch directly:

```ts
const surface = useEditableSurface()
surface?.requestEdit({
  objectKind: 'csv-cell',
  initialText: parsedCellValue,
  locator: { kind: 'csv-cell', start, end, delim },
})
```

CsvGrid uses this from RowDetailModal cell clicks (canvas can't host
DOM markers). CollectionView used to use this exclusively for jsonl;
post-Step-3 it also exposes `data-obj-src` so selection works there too.

---

## 4. Strategy interface

Per-type behavior lives in `src/components/workspace/inline-edit/strategies/`.
The empty `strategies/` directory in the repo is reserved for these.

```ts
// strategies/types.ts
export interface EditStrategy<L extends ObjectLocator = ObjectLocator> {
  kind: ObjectKind

  /** Entry point from a DOM Selection. md/html/jsonl implement this;
   *  csv leaves it null (click-only). The default impl runs the LCA
   *  resolution from §3.1; types override only when their DOM model
   *  differs. */
  fromSelection?(
    sel: Selection,
    host: HTMLElement,
  ): EditObject | null

  /** Save-time conversion. Receives the user's typed value plus the
   *  original file source (read out of the EditableSurface's data-source
   *  attribute) and returns the (old_string, new_string) pair handed to
   *  `/api/app/drive/edit`. */
  buildEdit(
    obj: EditObject,
    userValue: string,
    source: string,
  ): { old_string: string; new_string: string } | { error: string }

  /** Optional: which CodeMirror language extensions to load in the
   *  modal's EditorBody (see §6). md → markdown, html → html, csv/jsonl
   *  → none (plain text). */
  editorLanguage?: 'markdown' | 'html' | null
}

// strategies/registry.ts
export const STRATEGIES: Record<ObjectKind, EditStrategy>
```

`editable-surface.tsx` and `edit-modal.tsx` look strategies up from the
registry instead of branching on `objectKind`. Adding a fifth type
(say `tsv-cell`, `xlsx-cell`) is one new file in `strategies/` plus one
registry entry — no changes to surface or modal.

### 4.1 Per-type quick reference

| Strategy   | fromSelection? | buildEdit                                      |
|------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `md`       | ✓ default LCA  | `expandToUnique` anchor → bytes replace        |
| `html`     | ✓ default LCA + `findHtmlInnerRange` to scope to inner content | `expandToUnique` anchor → bytes replace |
| `csv`      | — (click only) | RFC4180 cell encoding around bytes replace     |
| `jsonl`    | ✓ default LCA  | re-stringify the line's raw object with the field overridden |

---

## 5. Save path (BFF & beyond)

Modal POSTs to `/api/app/drive/edit` with:

```ts
{
  file_path: string
  old_string: string         // from strategy.buildEdit()
  new_string: string         // from strategy.buildEdit()
  parent_blob_sha?: string   // freshness proof; SSR threads this through
}
```

When `parent_blob_sha` is present, the BFF skips the Read-first round
trip and goes straight to `huozi_edit`. The Worker validates the sha
and rejects on mismatch (errorCode 7 → 409 → user-visible "stale" toast).

Error mapping table is in `edit-modal.tsx#errorKey` — keep that in sync
with new MCP error codes.

---

## 6. Display overlay (CodeMirror)

The modal's textarea is replaced by an `EditorBody` component. For most
content it behaves like a textarea; for html and (rarely) markdown it
adds a **display-only overlay** that decodes safe-listed entities to
their unicode glyphs without touching the underlying bytes.

### 6.1 Why display-only

The user's typed bytes are saved verbatim. Auto-encoding (`"` → `&ldquo;`)
would break the bytes-in / bytes-out contract and create round-trip
ambiguity. Display-only side-steps the contract entirely: the document
model is bytes, the visible layer renders entities as glyphs, the cursor
treats each entity as one atomic position.

### 6.2 Whitelist (Phase 1)

Entry criterion: **decoded form has a unique, lossless unicode equivalent**.

| Entity                                    | Display |
|-------------------------------------------|---------|
| `&ldquo;` `&rdquo;` `&lsquo;` `&rsquo;`   | `\u201c \u201d \u2018 \u2019` |
| `&laquo;` `&raquo;`                       | `\u00ab \u00bb` |
| `&amp;` `&lt;` `&gt;` `&quot;` `&apos;`   | `& < > " '` |
| `&hellip;` `&mdash;` `&ndash;`            | `\u2026 \u2014 \u2013` |
| `&copy;` `&reg;` `&trade;`                | `\u00a9 \u00ae \u2122` |
| `&nbsp;`                                  | `\u00b7` (visible dot, dim) |

Phase 2: numeric character references via regex `/&#\d+;|&#x[0-9a-f]+;/i`.

Phase 3: invisible-character markers (NBSP, ZWSP, BOM, trailing whitespace)
— the *opposite* direction (bytes are unicode, display adds visibility).

### 6.3 Implementation

CodeMirror 6 primitives:

- `MatchDecorator` — runs the whitelist regex over the document
- `Decoration.replace({ widget })` — atomic widget per match
- The widget renders the decoded glyph with a dotted underline so users
  can tell entity-glyph apart from typed-glyph

CodeMirror loads lazily — first modal open pulls ~80–100 KB gzipped.
The unwrapped textarea is the SSR fallback for the first render.

### 6.4 What overlay does NOT do

- Does not decode entities on save. Bytes go out as bytes came in.
- Does not encode user-typed unicode to entities. If the user types `\u201c`,
  the file gets U+201C — not `&ldquo;`.
- Does not render markdown / html structure. `**bold**` and `<strong>`
  stay literal in the editor; only the entity *glyph* is sugar-coated.
- Does not fire on csv-cell / jsonl-field modals — those values are
  already-decoded strings.

A separate "Normalize entities → unicode" workspace action could batch-
convert at file scope, but is out of scope for the inline editor.

## 8. Implementation steps

Tracked in the session task list. In order:

1. **Strategy scaffolding.** Move existing if/else branches into per-type
   files; surface and modal go through the registry. Pure refactor.
2. **LCA resolution fix.** Replace `commonAncestorContainer` walk with
   start/end double anchor + LCA per §3.1. Adds the nested-object case.
3. **JSONL selection input.** CollectionView wraps each rendered field
   value in a `data-obj-src` span so selection works on jsonl too.
   Click-only path stays as a fallback.
4. **MD inline granularity.** Already shipped (`source-pos.ts` annotates
   inline tags). Verify and document; no code change expected.
5. **CodeMirror EditorBody.** Replace the textarea; add Phase 1 entity
   overlay; markdown / html syntax highlighting where useful.

Phases 2/3 of the overlay (numeric refs, invisible-char markers) and the
"Normalize entities" workspace action are tracked separately.
